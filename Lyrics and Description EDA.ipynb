    "\n",
    "A: I'd imagine they would be much more generic words that can be used in nearly any context, thus giving us very little tangible information from the corpus. Taking a glance at some of the stop words, some words that seem could be very high in any situation could be like \"and\", \"am\", \"because\", \"it's\", 'i', and others. Although, it seemed some \"I'm\"s slipped through in our pre-processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note, as well, that the words in the stopwords set contained punctuation like \"it's\" or \"don't\". In the above steps, I removed the punctuation after removing stopwords.\n",

    "#### Q: What were your prior beliefs about the lexical diversity between the artists? Does the difference (or lack thereof) in lexical diversity between the artists conform to your prior beliefs? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: I can really only answer this for the two artists I chose, Tom Petty and Frank Turner. I'd say that the difference of lexical diversity does about conform to my prior beliefs. Tom's songs are relatively simple and to the point, and Frank Turner has some lyric heavy songs with often-times some interesting references or usage of words. So, I expected Frank to have a higher lexical diversity, and it appeared to be true with his .406 vs Tom's .260. Still, Tom's is much higher than both Robyn and Cher's. I'm not very familiar with Robyn, but it also makes sense that there would be less diversity with pop-like music. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, Robyn and Cher each have a much larger dataset we're working off of, which I'd hypothesize would drive down the diversity naturally. I only looked at the first 20 songs for each Frank and Tom's discography, due to the issues with scraping data last assignment, and these are chronological as well. I'd like to scrap the rest and really see how, perhaps, their careers progressed with the uniqueness of words used. \n"
